# CI/CD Pipeline Architecture for Flask App Deployment on AWS

## Overview
This document outlines the continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline used to deploy a Flask application on AWS using services like CodePipeline, CodeBuild, ECS Fargate, and ECR. The infrastructure is provisioned using AWS CloudFormation with separate stacks for network, ECR, ECS, and CI/CD resources.

## üîß Components

### üßæ Source Control
- **GitHub Repository**
  - Contains all application and infrastructure code:
    - `README.md`
    - `Dockerfile`
    - `requirements.txt`
    - `buildspec.yml`
    - `imagedefinitions.json`
    - `app/app.py`
    - CloudFormation templates under `cloudformation/`

### üöÄ CI/CD Infrastructure
- **CodePipeline**
  - Triggers on GitHub commits
  - Orchestrates the build and deployment process
- **CodeBuild**
  - Executes build commands from `buildspec.yml`
  - Builds Docker image
  - Pushes image to Amazon ECR

### üê≥ Container Image Management
- **Amazon ECR**
  - Stores Docker images
  - Integrated with ECS for seamless deployments

### üõ≥Ô∏è Deployment Target
- **Amazon ECS Fargate**
  - Runs the Flask container as a service
  - Integrated with ALB for routing
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
  - Routes incoming HTTP requests to ECS tasks

### üåê Network Infrastructure (Provisioned via CloudFormation)
- **Network Stack**
  - VPC
  - Public and private subnets
  - Internet Gateway (IGW)
  - NAT Gateway
- **ECR Stack**
  - Creates and manages ECR repository
- **ECS Stack**
  - Creates ECS Cluster, Task Definition, and Fargate Service
- **CI/CD Stack**
  - Sets up CodePipeline and CodeBuild resources

## üì¶ Docker Image Build and Push (Manual Instructions)

You can manually build and push the Docker image to ECR using the following commands:

### 1. Authenticate Docker to ECR:
```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-south-1 \
  | docker login --username AWS \
  --password-stdin <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
```

### 2. Tag the Docker image:
```bash
docker tag mane-dev-ecr-repo:latest \
  <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/mane-dev-ecr-repo:latest
```

### 3. Push the Docker image to ECR:
```bash
docker push <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/mane-dev-ecr-repo:latest
```

### 4. (Optional) List images in ECR to verify:
```bash
aws ecr list-images \
  --repository-name mane-dev-ecr-repo \
  --region ap-south-1
```
